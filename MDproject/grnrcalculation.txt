For gr/nr calculation 
1) First rum the molecular dynamics code using the input parameter in your pmd.in file 
   2
   2 2 2
   4 4 4
   1.587401
   1.0
   0.003
   20000
   100

2) once your program is finished  you will see in your data folder have coordinate files have been saved 
   The name of the coordinate file in data folder will look like this :
   pmd00timestep , where timestep  is md-timestep 
    
3) In the same folder where you ran your MD program ,run gr.c program by typing ./gr

4) When you will run /gr you wil be asked to give four intputs
   Number of processors  Starttimestep increment Finishtimestep  (eg 8 1 1 10)
   Here Numbe of processors is the number of processors used in your MD program (here its 8)
        Starttimestep : the start timestep for your gr calculate (it timestep from pmd00timestep in data folder) 
        Finishtimestep: the finish timestep for your gr calculate (it timestep from pmd00timestep in data folder) 
        Note : Finishtimestep should be greater then Starttimestep
        Increment : it should be 1 in your program 

5) Plot gr and nr from gr.d
